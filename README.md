# SQL Database Project

This project contains SQL scripts for creating sample data, performing various join operations, and implementing indexes for database optimization.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Overview
- **`sample_data.sql`** - Contains sample data for Employees, Departments, and Orders tables.
- **`joins_queries.sql`** - Contains SQL queries for practicing different types of joins.
- **`indexes_queries.sql`** - Contains SQL queries to create and manage indexes for performance improvement.

## ðŸš€ Instructions

### Step 1: Run Sample Data Script
1. Copy the content of `sample_data.sql`.
2. Paste it into your SQL environment (e.g., DB Fiddle, MySQL Workbench, etc.).
3. Run the script to create and populate the tables.

### Step 2: Run Joins Queries
1. Copy the content of `joins_queries.sql`.
2. Run the queries to test INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, SELF JOIN and CROSS JOIN examples.

### Step 3: Run Indexes Queries
1. Copy the content of `indexes_queries.sql`.
2. Run the queries to create indexes and improve database query performance.

### Step 4: GitHub Submission
1. After updating your files in VS Code, run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated SQL scripts with improved queries"
git push
```

2. Copy your GitHub repository link and submit it as the final solution.

### Step 5: DB Fiddle Link Generation (For Published Link)
1. Visit [DB Fiddle](https://dbfiddle.uk/).
2. Paste the content of `sample_data.sql` followed by `joins_queries.sql` and `indexes_queries.sql`.
3. Click **Run** to test the code.
4. Click on **Share** and copy the generated link.
5. Submit this link along with your GitHub repository link.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Ensure you run `sample_data.sql` before executing the other scripts.
- For any errors or unexpected results, review the comments in the code for guidance.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
